        "Asylum under the Refugee Convention requires demonstrating a well-founded fear of persecution based on a protected class (race, religion, politics, etc.) by the government or actors the government cannot control.",
        "File asylum applications within one year of entering the U.S. and ensure the applicant has not been previously deported.",
        "Withholding of Removal under the Refugee Convention is for those ineligible for asylum due to missed deadlines or prior deportation, providing relief from deportation but no path to citizenship.",
        "Withholding of Removal under the Convention Against Torture requires proof of likely torture if returned to the home country, without time limits or protected class requirements, but does not offer a path to citizenship.",
        "Use a detailed cover letter to tell the applicant's story comprehensively and link events to evidence/exhibits; form questions can be brief summaries.",
        "Include exhibits such as personal evidence (affidavits, medical records, membership proofs), journalistic coverage, and human rights reports to substantiate the claim.",
        "Avoid economic hardship arguments unless tied to government persecution targeting jobs, property, or livelihood.",
        "Specify perpetrators of persecution; do not use vague terms like 'they' without clear antecedents.",
        "Demonstrate government involvement or inability to protect; private violence alone is insufficient.",
        "Establish a protected ground for persecution: race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group (PSG).",
        "Provide credible, specific, and consistent testimony and documentation to establish a well-founded fear of persecution.",
        "Tie instances of harm or threats directly to the protected ground, showing it is 'one central reason' for the persecution.",
        "Demonstrate government involvement through direct actions (e.g., police abuse) or inability/unwillingness to protect (e.g., failed police reports).",
        "Corroborate claims with evidence such as medical reports, affidavits, expert witness statements, and credible media or NGO reports.",
        "File within the one-year deadline unless exceptions (changed or extraordinary circumstances) apply and can be substantiated.",
        "Address potential bars to asylum (e.g., firm resettlement, criminal convictions) directly and proactively.",
        "Focus on showing that persecution is due to a protected ground, is above general hardship, and involves government action or inaction.",
        "Maintain consistency and address any discrepancies in the story with reasonable explanations.",
